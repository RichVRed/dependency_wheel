Dependency Wheel
================

This is a fork from the MooWheel Class version 0.2 from unwieldy studios <http://unwieldy.net>. Written by Augusto Becciu. You can get more information to MooWheel here <http://unwieldy.net/web/moowheel>
   
This fork is customized to visualize dependencies for software libraries. 
It is used on <https://www.versioneye.com> to show recursive dependencies for Java and Ruby Projects. 

This fork is very strongly customized for VersionEye. But anyway! Feel free to take a look and get some inspiration :-)
